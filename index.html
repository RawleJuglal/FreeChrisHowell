    <p>Fighting for a fair trial and freedom</p>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>What Happened?</h2>
    <p>Chris was convicted without a fair trial. New evidence and investigative misconduct have come to light, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The State failed to respond to his post-conviction filing in time, violating Oklahoma law (22 O.S. § 1089(D)(1)).</li>
      <li>Chris was denied an evidentiary hearing, despite presenting newly discovered material facts (22 O.S. § 1084).</li>
      <li>Evidence was withheld, testimony conflicted, and key figures failed to disclose personal involvement, violating due process and Brady/Napue standards.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Chris has spent years behind bars based on a flawed process. This isn’t just about one man—it’s about ensuring our justice system follows its own rules. If this can happen to him, it can happen to anyone.</p>
